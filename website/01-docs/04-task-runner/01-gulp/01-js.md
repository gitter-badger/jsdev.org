Best course what i've seen about assembly javascript by gulp is **[Pluralsight] JavaScript Build Automation With Gulp.js**

Stupid bitch Kelly Manley From PiracySolution, blocked my repos what I typed by myself.  
https://bitbucket.org/marley-nodejs/kelly-manley-from-piracysolution-stupid-bitch

And now I do not recommend to by this course. Try to find it on the internet for free. It simply.
