### JavaScript Development Environment


<br/>

<a href="/env/atom/">Atom</a> || <a href="/env/docker/">Docker</a>


I'm working on ubuntu linux 14.04 LTS with Docker and my IDE is Atom with some plugins. No more anything need for comfort development.

For develop app in the browser, without anything else, you can use c9.io service.
