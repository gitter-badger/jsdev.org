### JAVALABS

**I decided to move list of books and video courses about java development to <a href="http://javalabs.org/">javalabs.org</a>**


### If you planning to watch any Video Course or read any book about Java Development and want to discuss it, we can create discussion board on javalabs.org


GitHub can help to us. We can create issue, discuss, send pull request to improve code and etc.
If it would be interesting to you, send link on course what you planning to study and link to your github || bitbucket repo.

For example github on video course:
