Now I'm working on position Oracle ADF Developer (That is a Java Framework with JSF Technologies). And we develop applications like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79QQbQ-PDkM" rel="nofollow">this</a>.


<br/>

<br/><br/>

I'm planning to complete next video courses:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marley-angular/Angular-2-Getting-Started"   rel="nofollow">"Angular 2: Getting Started"</a></li>
    <li>Learn MeteorJS By Building 10 Real World Projects</li>
    <li>Projects in MongoDB Learn MongoDB Building Ten Projects</li>
    <li>[Frontend Masters] Rethinking Asynchronous JavaScript [2016, ENG]</li>
