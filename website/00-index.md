# JavaScript Development

<br/>

There is absolutely new website about javascript development.


<br/>

I'm start working on video course "ReactJS and Flux Learn By Building 10 Projects".

Here is my <a href="https://github.com/marley-react/ReactJS-and-Flux-Learn-By-Building-10-Projects" rel="nofollow">repo</a>.

If someone will do same, It would be much more interesting that if it I will do it alone.

<br/><br/>

After I will finish it,  I'm planning to complete video course "Angular 2: Getting Started".


<br/><br/>


My public repos with javascript projects:

<br/>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marley-nodejs" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marley-angular" rel="nofollow">Angular.js</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marley-react" rel="nofollow">React.js</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marley-js" rel="nofollow">JavaScript</a></li>
</ul>


<br/><br/>

More links with no javascrpt repos you can find on my <a href="https://marley.org" rel="nofollow">website</a>

<br/><br/>


Top Courses what you should watch about development: <br/><br/>


    Docker for Web Developers (Pluralsight)
    JavaScript Build Automation With Gulp.js (Pluralsight)

<br/>


Because copy writes blocked my repos (I typed it by myself) on github.  
I recommend not to buy this courses! Try to find it on trackers, file shares etc.
